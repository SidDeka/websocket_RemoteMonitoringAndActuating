IoT node (server) with two systems (use LEDs) that can be controlled remotely from two other IoT nodes (an ESP32 and a phone/PC). The server should have an (MPU6050) sensor that can be monitored both locally (LCD or OLED) and remotely on the connected clients. 


Components:
ESP32 WROOM DA board 
BME280 sensor
MPU 6050 sensor
TSL2561 sensor
LCD (liquid crystal display)
I2C interface
2, LEDS
3, PUSH BUTTONS
5, 330 ohm resistors
I2C OLED Screen Driver DC 3.3V~5V
